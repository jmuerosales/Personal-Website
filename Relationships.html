                Manila. We all have the same hobby which is to play online games where we can spend more than 8 hours a day playing together even if there is a class on <br>
                the day after. We also love to explore the place we are in when together. I hope we can spend more time together as the pandemic made us not see each other <br>
                for more than a year.
