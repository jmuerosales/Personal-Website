                    <h1> I started learning about video games when I was young as all my relatives love to play it. I took interest on it 
                        as I watch them play and decided to play it as well. My brother influenced me on playing console games (Playstation & Nintendo)
                        and the genre of games we play are JRPG's which stands for Japanese Role-Playing Games. It is a type of game where you 
                        will play a character by his/her role in the story you will play. It is an offline game which a single game can take more
                        than 50 hours of playtime to finish.  We are also interested in multiplayer games especially mobile online 
                        games as it is very handy to bring and play. I tend to play a lot with it along with my cousins and friends.

                        this gaming industry is also known for their anime-based games such as Naruto and Dragonball. My brother likes
                        this genre of games very much and as I tend to watch him I also took interest on it. This series of games is 
                        usually about a story of a person where he/she starts from the bottom and wants something due to a certain 
                        reason and they have to get stronger to attain it.

                        as much as possible the story of it is a bit dark which makes it interesting. My brother is the one who introduced
                        this game to me and I can't wait for another persona game to be released. They also have an anime version, but I prefer
                        the game as it is much well funded by developers and animators rather than the anime.

                        about war and is a turn-based game which has a great fantasy plot where I really get into it when I play. It challenges
                        my critical thinking as this is also a strategy game since it is about war. The animation is up to my liking and its 
                        gameplay has a unique feeling into it as I love thinking how to outwit the enemy with limited resources.

                        are playable in game and it re-tells the story using the main characters accompanying them in their world.

                        However due to slow updates on the game that time after 2 months we stopped and plans to wait for more contents so we
                        can play it longer. This game is like the JRPG's I mentioned earlier but is an online game and has a more open-world
